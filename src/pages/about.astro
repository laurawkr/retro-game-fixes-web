  <h1>About Retro Game Fixes</h1>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>What This Site Is</h2>
    <p>
      Retro Game Fixes is a small personal project focused on keeping
      <strong>classic PC games</strong> playable on modern systems
      (especially Windows 10 &amp; 11).
    </p>
    <p>
      Guides focus on practical steps: installing the game, applying
      compatibility wrappers like <strong>dgVoodoo2</strong>, and
      working around issues like old DRM and broken launchers.
