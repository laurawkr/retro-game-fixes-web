# How to Run *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone* (PC CD-ROM, US) on Modern Windows

Follow this guide to get *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone* (original PC CD-ROM, US version) running on **Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 10, and Windows 11**

---

## Supported Systems

- Windows 95 - intalls and runs without issues.
- Windows 7 - installs and runs fine in most cases, running in compatability mode solves rare issues
- Windows 10 - installs but will crash without dgVoodoo2.
- Windows 11 - installs but will crash without dgVoodoo2.

If you’re on **Windows 10 or 11**, don’t even bother trying to run the game without dgVoodoo2—it will be unstable and usually crash quickly.

## Why the Game Crashes on Modern Windows

The PC version of HP1 was built for early DirectX and uses legacy **SafeDisc** copy protection. On modern systems:

- Legacy DirectX calls don’t behave correctly with new GPUs.
- SafeDisc DRM is blocked by Windows security.
- Optical drives run at different speeds than when the game was released.

Result: installs may work, but the game will often **crash on launch, give a safedisc warning, or close after a few seconds**.

My favorite fix is to find a legal solution to the SafeDisc issue (e.g., an official re-release/digital version if available), and to use **dgVoodoo2**, a graphics wrapper that translates old DirectX calls into something modern Windows understands.

In my case, using these are the only two fixes needed to get you up and running without any issues.

## Step 1 – Install the Game (All Systems)

1. Insert your original **Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone** PC CD-ROM.
2. Run the installer and let it complete.
4. Once installed, **do not launch the game yet** on Windows 10/11—go straight to dgVoodoo2.

---

## Step 2 – Download and Install dgVoodoo2

1. Download dgVoodoo2 from the official site.
2. Extract the ZIP to a temporary folder.
3. From the `MS` subfolder, copy these files into your HP1 game folder (where the game EXE lives):
   - `D3D8.dll`
   - `D3DImm.dll`
   - `DDraw.dll` (if present)
4. Copy `DgVoodooCpl.exe` into the same folder for convenience.

Now dgVoodoo2 will intercept old DirectX calls and handle them in a modern way.

---

## Step 3 – Configure dgVoodoo2

1. Run `DgVoodooCpl.exe`.
2. On the **General** tab:
   - Set the output API to a modern option (e.g., DirectX 11/12).
   - Leave the rest at defaults for now.
3. On the **DirectX** tab:
   - Set the resolution to your monitor resolution or a 4:3 resolution you like.
   - Enable aspect ratio correction if you want to avoid stretching.
   - Apply settings.

Click **OK** to save and close dgVoodoo2.

## Step 4 - Address Safedisc issues

1. If you are encountering safedisc issues please navigate to the safedisc fixes page for available solutions.

---

## Windows 7 Notes

On **Windows 7**:

- The game usually installs and launches without extra tricks.
- It can still crash or behave oddly without dgVoodoo2.

With dgVoodoo2 configured:

- Crashes are greatly reduced.
- You can use higher resolutions and get smoother performance.

---

## Windows 10 & Windows 11 Notes

On **Windows 10/11**, you will typically see:

- Crash on launch.
- Window opens and closes immediately.
- SafeDisc authorization messages.

Using dgVoodoo2:

1. Right-click the game EXE and choose **Run as administrator**.
2. If you see any SafeDisc prompts, allow them to proceed.
3. The game should now launch and stay stable, with dgVoodoo2 handling the old graphics calls.

---

## Resolution and Fullscreen

If the game looks wrong:

- **Black bars:** try a resolution in dgVoodoo2 that matches your monitor aspect ratio.
- **Stretched image:** enable aspect ratio correction in the DirectX tab.
- **Tiny window:** set a higher resolution and enable fullscreen.

The goal is to target either the original 4:3 look or a comfortable widescreen mode.

---

## Audio

After dgVoodoo2 is installed:

- Most users report **no audio issues**.
- If you hear crackling or missing audio:
  - Check your Windows sound output device.
  - Disable “exclusive mode” enhancements.
  - Lower output quality (e.g., from 192kHz to 48kHz) temporarily and test again.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I do this without dgVoodoo2?**  
A: On modern Windows, it’s usually not worth trying. The game is crash-prone without a wrapper.

**Q: Do I need a virtual machine?**  
A: This guide is focused on **native Windows**. VMs (like XP in VirtualBox) are possible but add complexity.

**Q: Is this legal?**  
A: You should own the original game. This guide only uses official tools and archival solutions, not pirated copies.
